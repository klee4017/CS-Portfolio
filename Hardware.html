        <h2 id="p">On this page, I will be showing you parts of a computer that are vital for its function. Each description will have a picture of that part underneath it.</h2>
        <p>This is a motherboard. The motherboard contains the physical arrangements of a computer's basic circuitry and components. It also directs power to all the other computer components as well as allowing all the components to communicate with each other.

        <p>The CPU, or central processing unit, processes and carries basic instructions of computer programs. The CPU acts as the brain of the computer. Every bit of information that goes through the computer has to first go through the CPU.
