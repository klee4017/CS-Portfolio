        <h2>On this page, I will be showing you parts of a computer that are vital for its function. Each description will have a picture of that part underneath it.</h2>

        <div id="motherboard"><h3>Motherboard</h3>
        <p>This is a motherboard. The motherboard contains the physical arrangements of a computer's basic circuitry and components. It also directs power to all the other computer components as well as allowing all the components to communicate with each other.
        In a way, the motherboard is the leader and the messanger of the computer system. It tells other parts what to do at certain times as well as passing messages from one part of the computer to another part.

Btw it is src not scr
I put in a temporary picture and made a file for the pictures
    - You need to know where to find your pictures and label them correctly or else you won't be able to organize it as you normally would
      - I have a pictures folder with a few sub folders in it to clear it up
Also, make sure all the picture names are lowercase...
    - It just makes it easier for you to type out later
I made a few changes to it as you can see in the underlined part.

If you want to see my hardware page it is here:
    - https://preview.c9users.io/sniparszach/yoloswagfirstproject_exe/hardware.html
With the code here:
    - https://github.com/SniparsZach/Computer-Science/blob/gh-pages/hardware.html
    
Hope this helps!

PS. Have me proof read for gods sake... scr? like really.... its src for source not scr...
Another note.
    - Download your pictures unless if it is for a background, if the source is deleted then so does the picture since it is using it is being grabbed for that moment.
        If the picture is downloaded then uploaded, the picture won't be wiped unless you delete it youself.

<!--
New Note:
Since the pictures are in a subfolder, to link pictures you need to have it "pictures/[picturename]" instead of "[picturename]"
Also, make sure to check the image type, png or jpg.

Using the tag <center></center> is much easier than using CSS if you are only using it on one element at a time.

        <div id="cpu"><h3>CPU</h3>
        <p>The CPU, or central processing unit, processes and carries basic instructions of computer programs. The CPU acts as the brain of the computer. Every bit of information that goes through the computer has to first go through the CPU.

        <div id="ram"><<h3>RAM</h3>
        <p>The RAM requires a power source in order to run. Standing for Random Access Memory, RAM stores and allows a user to retrieve memory. The memory that is stored are things such as browsing history or downloads from the internet. Because these memories are stored on the computer itself, it is easier to access compared to other storage devices such as CDs and hard drives.

        <div id="harddrive"><h3>Hard Drive</h3>
        <p>A hard drive is used as a permanent place to store information that can be accessed again in the future. If a hard drive were to crash, that information would be lost and would then be unretrievable. This is why you store and backup your data onto a separate hard drive just in case.

        <div id="keyboard"><h3>Keyboard</h3>
        <p>On most computers, a keyboard is the primary text input device. That means that it is the main device that sends text information to the computer.

        <div id="mouse"><h3>Mouse</h3>
        <p>A mouse is used as a primary input device. It is mostly used to direct a cursor on screen to where the user wants it to go as well as allowing a user to to perform many functions such as selecting a certain areas on-screen. 
        Computer mouses are either connected to the motherboard with a wire/cord or through a USB drive which is wireless and allows the user to be free of cords as the mouse sends signals to the USB drive which communicates to the motherboard where the mouse is moving.

        <div id="monitor"><h3>Monitor</h3>
        <p>The monitor is used to show what computer is doing, whether it be surfing the web or typing an essay. The monitor is how you are able to read this website! 
        Compared to the past, monitors today are able to show text as well as images. Not only that, but monitors today tend to be thinner and lighter for easier transport for computers such as laptops. Some monitors today also have touchscreen abilies, meaning that you can use your fingers as the mouse.
